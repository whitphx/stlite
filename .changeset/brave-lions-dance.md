Improve demo apps and E2E tests:

- Add counter functionality to multi-app demos to demonstrate independent session state
- Rename shared-worker demo to multi-app-shared-worker for clarity
- Combine smoke and snapshot tests to reduce E2E execution time
- Remove unnecessary inline styles from basic demo
