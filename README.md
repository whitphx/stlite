A port of [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to WebAssembly, powered by [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/).

Streamlit is a Python web app framework for the fast development of data apps. This project is to make it run completely on web browsers.

## Try it out

Visit the [playground demo](https://whitphx.github.io/stlite/).

## Samples
### ‚ö°Ô∏èServerless Image Processing App
Image processing with OpenCV works on the client-side.
* Repositoryüìå: https://github.com/whitphx/stlite-image-processing-app
* Online demoüéà: https://whitphx.github.io/stlite-image-processing-app/

## Use stlite on your web page
You can use _stlite_ on your web page loading the script via a `<script>` tag.
Here is a sample HTML file.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">
  <title>stlite app</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <script src="https://whitphx.github.io/stlite/lib/mountable/stlite.js" ></script>
  <script>
    stlite.mount(`
import streamlit as st

name = st.text_input('Your name')
st.write("Hello,", name or "world")
`,
    document.getElementById("root"))
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this sample,
* stlite library is imported with the first script tag, then the global `stlite` object becomes available.
* `stlite.mount()` mounts the Streamlit app on the `<div id="root" />` element as specified via the second argument. The app script is passed via the first argument.

### More controls

If more controls are needed such as installing dependencies or mounting multiple files, use the following API instead.

```js
    stlite.mount({
      requirements: ["matplotlib"],  // Packages to install
      entrypoint: "streamlit_app.py",  // The target file of the `streamlit run` command
      files: {
        "streamlit_app.py": `
import streamlit as st
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

size = st.slider("Sample size", 100, 1000)

arr = np.random.normal(1, 1, size=size)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(arr, bins=20)

st.pyplot(fig)
`
      }
    },
    document.getElementById("root"))
```

> **Warning**
> stlite is at the very beginning of its development and the API can drastically change without any notice in the future.
Moreover, the hosted JS runtime is not versioned now, so future API changes may cause problems with backward compatibility.

## Development
### Building the packages

In the root directory,
```shell
make
```

After building, you can run the playground app by running the command below. Access http://localhost:5001/
```shell
make serve
```
