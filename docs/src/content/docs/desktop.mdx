description: Convert your Streamlit application into a desktop app.
---

`@stlite/desktop` allows you to convert your [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) application into a desktop app with [Stlite](https://github.com/whitphx/stlite) runtime, a [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/)-based Wasm-port of Streamlit.

import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import stliteDesktopBanner from '../../assets/desktop/stlite-desktop-banner-outlined.svg';

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Project

Create a `package.json` file for your new project:

import packageJson from '../../examples/desktop/package.json?raw';
import pkg from '@stlite/desktop/package.json';

export const packageJsonWithVersion = packageJson.replace('{{VERSION}}', pkg.version);

<Code code={packageJsonWithVersion} lang="json" title="package.json" />

Run installation:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 2. Create Application

Create `app.py`:

import appPy from '../../examples/desktop/app.py?raw';

<Code code={appPy} lang="python" title="app.py" />

### 3. Build & Run

**Dump artifacts (prepare build):**
```bash
npm run dump
```

**Preview:**
```bash
npm run serve
```

**Distribute:**
```bash
npm run app:dist
```
This generates the application files (`.app`, `.exe`, etc.) in the `dist` directory.

## Configuration

Configure your app via the `stlite.desktop` section in `package.json`.

### Files and Dependencies

```json
"stlite": {
  "desktop": {
    "files": ["app.py", "pages/*.py", "assets"],
    "entrypoint": "app.py",
    "dependencies": ["numpy", "pandas"],
    "requirementsTxtFiles": ["requirements.txt"]
  }
}
```

- **files**: Files and directories to include.
- **entrypoint**: The main script to run.
- **dependencies**: List of packages to install.
- **requirementsTxtFiles**: List of `requirements.txt` files to install.

### UI Customization

Hide the toolbar and hamburger menu (Embed mode):

```json
"stlite": {
  "desktop": {
    "embed": true
  }
}
```

## File System & Persistence

### IndexedDB Persistence

Mount an IndexedDB-backed directory to persist files across restarts.

```json
"stlite": {
  "desktop": {
    "idbfsMountpoints": ["/mnt"]
  }
}
```

### Local File Access (NodeJS Worker)

To access the host OS file system, enable `nodeJsWorker` and mount directories.

```json
"stlite": {
  "desktop": {
    "nodeJsWorker": true,
    "nodefsMountpoints": {
      "/mnt": "."
    }
  }
}
```

This mounts the current directory (`.`) of the host to `/mnt` in the virtual file system.

> [!TIP]
> You can use placeholders like `{{home}}`, `{{userData}}`, `{{temp}}` in the host paths.

#### Security Considerations

When NodeJS worker mode is enabled, the Python code executes within a Node.js worker thread in the main process. This means:

- **The Python code has the same privileges as the Node.js process itself.** It can access the file system, spawn child processes, make network requests, and perform any operation that Node.js can do.
- **There is no sandbox.** Unlike the default Web Worker mode (which runs in a browser-like sandboxed environment), NodeJS worker mode provides no isolation between your Python code and the host operating system.
- **You are responsible for the security of your app.** If your app executes untrusted Python code or loads untrusted packages, those could potentially harm the user's system.

This is an intentional design to enable powerful features like direct file system access via NODEFS. However, you should only use this mode when you trust all Python code and packages that your app will execute.

## Limitations

- **External Links**: Navigation to external URLs (e.g. `st.markdown("[link](https://...)")`) is restricted for security.
