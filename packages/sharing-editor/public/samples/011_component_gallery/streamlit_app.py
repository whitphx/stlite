### Notes

The page files (`pages/*`) are copied from [the Streamlit official document sample directory (`docs/python/api-examples-source`)](https://github.com/streamlit/docs/tree/cf0a57b2d14609b7f7d9029481cee480eed6fe1e/python/api-examples-source)
excluding the sub directories.

The following files have been changed:
* `widget.download_button.py`:
  A local file path in the source code has been rewritten to adjust to the directory structure of this sample app.

Due to the browser environment limitations,
some components do not work well.
The known issues are listed at https://github.com/whitphx/stlite#limitations.
