_A port of [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to WebAssembly, powered by [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/)_.

Streamlit is a Python web app framework for the fast development of data apps.
**stlite** project is to make it run **completely on web browsers**.

**ðŸ‘ˆ Select a demo from the sidebar** to see some examples
of what stlite can do!

**ðŸ‘‡ Edit the source code** in the editor to run any code you like!

To install additional packages, edit and save the `requirements` tab in the editor.

Tips: Only pure Python packages and C-extensions built for Pyodide can be installed.
For more information, read [this document](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/loading-packages.html).
stlite uses [`micropip.install()`](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/api/micropip-api.html#micropip.install) in its internals for installing packages.
