# `@stlite/stlite`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and its TypeScript template. The CRA version was v4.0.3, which is compatible with the Streamlit frontend.

The build script has been ejected and customized to make the production build as a library that does not contain the files in `public/` while keeping the development build as an app with hot-reload. See https://github.com/whitphx/stlite/pull/15 about it.
